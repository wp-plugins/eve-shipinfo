Puts an EVE Online ships database in your WordPress website, along with high quality screenshots and specialized shortcodes.

== Description ==

Using shortcodes, you can link EVE Online ship names in your posts and show inline information about EVE Online ships, including custom ship screenshots independent from the EVE Online website. Each ship also gets its own, fully detailed page in your blog with virtual pages. All EVE Online ships are bundled, including the skinned variants (Abaddon Tash-Murkon Edition) and special edition ships (Mimir) or even those you cannot fly (Immovable Enigma).

== Features ==

*   Portable EVE Online ships database with all 393 ships
*   786 high quality custom ship screenshots (front/side)
*   Link ship names to info popups or virtual ship pages within your blog
*   Extremely customizable ship lists shortcode
*   Ship galleries shortcode
*   Full integrated shortcode reference
*   Entirely translation-ready, including all ship attribute labels
*   For developers: easy object-oriented access to the ships database
*   Self-contained: no dependencies

== Installation ==

1. Install from your WordPress plugin manager
1. Activate the plugin
1. Go to your permalink settings, and save the settings without changing anything (to refresh the permalinks)
1. Optional: Download and install the screenshots pack

== Install the screenshots pack ==

Due to the size of the ship screenshots gallery, they are available as a separate download. Including
it would have made it impossible to install the plugin on most shared hosting packs, so on wordpress.org's
recommendation I did not include them in the repository.

You can download the screenshots pack here:

Note: to install the screenshots pack, you will need access to your wordpress's plugins folder, for 
example via FTP. You have to upload the "gallery" folder to the "eve-shipinfo" plugin folder.
